985,Argentina,"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards,88,20,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon,Pascual Toso
986,Portugal,"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",Late Bottled Vintage,88,,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),Port,Quinta de la Rosa
987,Australia,"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.",,88,25,South Australia,Barossa Valley,,,,Sieber Rd 2007 Viognier (Barossa Valley),Viognier,Sieber Rd
988,US,"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",,88,20,Oregon,Oregon,Oregon Other,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine_,Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),Pinot Gris,Lachini
989,Spain,"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",,88,53,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),Tempranillo Blend,Mauro
990,US,"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",,88,12,California,California,California Other,,,Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),Sauvignon Blanc,Dancing Bull
991,France,"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well.",Les Mirlandes,88,,Southwest France,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Domaine de Mirail 2005 Les Mirlandes Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine de Mirail
992,France,"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.",Grande Tradition,88,14,Southwest France,Gaillac,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Domaine des Terrisses 2006 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac),Red Blend,Domaine des Terrisses
993,France,"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure.

994,France,"An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.",Les Belles Vignes,88,22,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),Sauvignon Blanc,Fournier Père et Fils
995,Italy,"Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.",Edèlmio,88,26,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,,,Benanti 2006 Edèlmio White (Sicilia),White Blend,Benanti
996,Italy,"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration.

997,Australia,"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit.

998,US,"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",,88,18,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine_,The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),Pinot Gris,The Four Graces
